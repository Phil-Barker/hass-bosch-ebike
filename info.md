- 📊 **Statistics** - Monitor battery health and usage over time
- 🏠 **Smart Home Integration** - Integrate with your existing automations

## Detailed Requirements

### Hardware (Must Purchase Separately)

- **Bosch ConnectModule** - ~€100-150
  - NOT included with most bikes
  - Must be installed on your bike
  - Available from Bosch dealers

### Subscription (Annual Cost)

- **Bosch eBike Flow+** - ~€30-50/year
  - Required for cloud features
  - Subscribe in the Flow app

### Software

- **Bosch eBike Flow app** (Gen 4 only)
- **Home Assistant** 2024.1.0 or newer

## Installation

1. Add this repository to HACS as a custom repository
2. Search for "Bosch eBike Flow" in HACS
3. Install the integration
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration
6. Search for "Bosch eBike Flow"
7. Follow the OAuth login flow

## How It Works

The integration polls the Bosch eBike Cloud API every 5 minutes. The ConnectModule on your bike updates the cloud when:

- The bike is charging (plugged in)
- The bike is powered on
- The alarm is triggered by motion

This means sensors update in real-time while charging, making it perfect for monitoring charge sessions and creating smart charging automations.

        entity_id: sensor.your_bike_battery_level
        above: 80
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.your_bike_battery_charging
        state: "on"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.your_smart_plug
```

### Notify When Fully Charged

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Notify when eBike fully charged"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.your_bike_battery_level
        above: 99
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.your_bike_battery_charging
        state: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "🚴‍♂️ eBike Ready!"
